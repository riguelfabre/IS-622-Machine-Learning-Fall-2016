Riguel Fabre 10/2/2016 Week 4 HW - Feed forward Networks
In creating this nueral network i took the steps of making dataset, creating make model, train model using the data and evaluated. I decided to use 100 examples in my data set since in the class I saw 40 example was used and was enough. I trained the network using the following loss functions mean absolute value and mean squared error. I found that the error rate using the mean squared error loss function is higher then when using the mean absolute value loss function. At the end I compared the expected values against the predicted values in order to see how my model preformed. The preformance was ok, there were time that it got very close to the expected but other time it was off by alot.
